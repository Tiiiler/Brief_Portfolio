			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src ="images/aboutmepic3.jpg" alt ="Myself" id="me">
			<p>My name is Tyler Green, and I am currently on my 4th Year pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. I have had two legitmate jobs, neither of which have anything to do with my field of study unfortunately. I worked at Meijer for 2 and a half years and I have worked at Target for a little over a year. I did however learn some useful knowledge that has improved my work ethic and interaction with my coworkers and clients. I have lived in Ohio for basically all of my life, but I would like to move somewhere else after I obtain my degree. I have an interest in home automation and the overall idea of using technology to make our lives and future generation lives more efficient.</p>

					<h3>Programming Section</h3>
					<img src ="images/programming.png" alt ="Prgramming Word Map">
					<p>As I move through my schedule each semester I obtain more and more knowledge about programming in specific languages and programming in general. I have learned multiple different languages and used many softwares through all of the classes that I have taken. I have done programming in both and Object-Oriented languages and non Object-Oriented languages. In addition to this, I have also been taught many different tactics to tackle a program starting with the planning all throughout the debugging and testing of the final program.</p>

					<h3>Web Development Section</h3>
					<img src ="images/web.jpg" alt ="Web Word Map">
					<p>My web development experience is far from superb but I am learning my way how to create web pages and how to style them to fit the needs of my audience. I have only been developing web sites for less than a year and have only taken this class on it; so I am no expert. There is still a ton to learn and practice. I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS, including some Javascript and Jquery. With a little knowlege of all of these, and the help of Google, I shall find a way to achieve what ever task I may be presented with.</p>
